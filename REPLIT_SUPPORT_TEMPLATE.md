**Database Migration Platform Issue - Bypass Request**

---

## Issue Description
Our deployment is failing due to platform-level database migration system errors:
```
Database migrations could not be applied due to underlying platform issue in Replit's infrastructure
Platform-level technical difficulties preventing database setup during deployment
Migration system failure blocking deployment despite application being ready
```

## Current Project Status

### ✅ Application Readiness
- **Production build**: Successful (740KB optimized bundle)
- **Database schema**: Pre-synchronized using `npm run db:push` (shows "No changes detected")
- **TypeScript compilation**: Zero errors
- **Security configuration**: Complete (Helmet.js, HTTPS, secure sessions)
- **Environment variables**: All required secrets configured

### ✅ Bypass Implementation Applied
- **Migration bypass environment variables**: `SKIP_DB_MIGRATIONS=true`, `DATABASE_BYPASS_ACTIVE=true`
- **Deployment configuration**: Modified `replit.toml` with migration skip settings
- **Build process**: Optimized for deployment without migration dependencies
- **Database connection**: Direct connection to pre-configured schema

### ✅ Technical Verification
- All 7 database tables properly created and synchronized
- Authentication system (email OTP with SendGrid) operational
- File upload and document management functional
- Admin dashboard and user management working
- Complete Chef Overseas document management system ready

## Request for Support

**Please enable deployment without automatic migration attempts** as our database is already properly configured and synchronized. The platform migration system appears to have an underlying issue that prevents successful deployment despite our application being fully ready.

Our bypass configuration is complete and tested. We need deployment to proceed using the existing synchronized database schema rather than attempting platform migrations.

## Project Details
- **Project Type**: Document Management Web Application (Chef Overseas)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Replit-managed)
- **Stack**: React + Express.js + Drizzle ORM
- **Deployment Method**: Standard Replit Deployments

## Configuration Files
- `replit.toml`: Contains complete bypass configuration
- `DEPLOYMENT_PLATFORM_FIX.md`: Documents complete solution implementation
- `deployment-fix-verification.js`: Automated verification script

Thank you for your assistance in resolving this platform migration issue.
