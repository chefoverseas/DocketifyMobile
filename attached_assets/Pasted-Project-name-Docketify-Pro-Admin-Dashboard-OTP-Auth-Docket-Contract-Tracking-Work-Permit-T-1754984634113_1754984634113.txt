New Module: Work Permit Tracking

Purpose:
Track the work permit application process for each user, allowing the admin to manage statuses and upload final approved documents.

Roles:
- Admin:
  - Manage work permit status for each user.
  - Upload the final work permit docket file (PDF).
  - Status options:
    1. Preparation
    2. Applied
    3. Awaiting Embassy Decision
    4. Approved
    5. Rejected
- User:
  - View current work permit status.
  - Download final approved work permit file when available.

Data Model (Firestore):
- `/users/{uid}/workpermit`
  - status: "preparation" | "applied" | "awaiting_decision" | "approved" | "rejected"
  - final_docket_url: string (URL to PDF uploaded by admin)
  - lastUpdated: timestamp
  - notes: optional string for extra details (admin can set)

Storage Paths:
- `/workpermit/{uid}/final_docket.pdf`

Pages to Generate:
1. **Admin Pages**
   - `/admin/workpermit/[uid].js` — Manage work permit for a specific user:
     - Select status from dropdown.
     - Upload final docket PDF (only enabled when status = Approved).
     - Save changes to Firestore.
     - View history/log of status changes (optional).
   - Integrate link to this page from `/admin/user/[uid]` dashboard.

2. **User Pages**
   - `/workpermit.js` — View current status + any uploaded final docket PDF (if Approved).
   - Show timeline of statuses (optional visual with Tailwind steps component).

Admin Workflow:
1. Go to a user’s work permit management page.
2. Choose a status from dropdown.
3. If "Approved", upload final docket PDF.
4. Save — updates Firestore and notifies the user (optional Cloud Function for email/SMS).
5. User sees updated status immediately.

User Workflow:
1. Log in via OTP.
2. Go to Work Permit page.
3. View current status:
   - If "Approved", download final docket PDF.
   - If not, see status label and last updated date.

UI Components:
- `WorkPermitStatusBadge.jsx` — color-coded badge for statuses.
- `FileUploader.jsx` (existing) — adapted for admin PDF upload.
- `StatusDropdown.jsx` — admin status selector.
