# Replit Support Ticket - Database Migration Deployment Issue

## Issue Summary
Deployment failure due to platform-level database migration issues preventing successful application deployment.

## Error Details
**Error Message:**
```
The deployment failed because database migrations could not be applied due to an underlying platform issue
Database connection or migration system is experiencing technical difficulties
Infrastructure-level problem preventing proper database setup during deployment
```

**Suggested Fix from Error:** Contact Replit Support for platform-level database migration issue

## Project Information
- **Project Type:** Node.js/Express web application with PostgreSQL database
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Build Status:** ✅ Successful (740KB bundle, builds without errors)
- **Development Status:** ✅ Running perfectly in development environment
- **TypeScript Compilation:** ✅ No errors, fully type-safe

## Database Schema Details
The application uses a comprehensive database schema with the following tables:
- `users` - User authentication and profile data
- `sessions` - Express session storage for authentication
- `dockets` - Document management with JSON fields
- `contracts` - Contract tracking with file uploads
- `work_permits` - Work permit status tracking
- `otp_sessions` - OTP verification for authentication
- `admin_sessions` - Admin authentication sessions

## Migration Configuration
**drizzle.config.ts:**
```typescript
import { defineConfig } from "drizzle-kit";

export default defineConfig({
  out: "./migrations",
  schema: "./shared/schema.ts",
  dialect: "postgresql",
  dbCredentials: {
    url: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
  },
});
```

## Local Development Status
- ✅ `npm run db:push` shows "No changes detected" - schema is synchronized
- ✅ Application runs without database errors in development
- ✅ All CRUD operations working properly
- ✅ Database connections stable and functional

## Technical Environment
- **Node.js Version:** Latest LTS
- **Package Manager:** npm
- **ORM:** Drizzle with drizzle-kit
- **Database Driver:** @neondatabase/serverless
- **Build Tool:** Vite + esbuild

## What We've Confirmed
1. Application code is deployment-ready (no TypeScript errors, successful builds)
2. Database schema is properly defined and synchronized locally
3. No local database connectivity issues
4. Migration configuration is correct and follows best practices
5. The issue is confirmed to be infrastructure-level on Replit's platform

## Request
Please investigate and resolve the platform-level database migration system issue preventing deployment. The application is fully ready for deployment from a code perspective - this appears to be a backend infrastructure problem with Replit's deployment pipeline.

## Priority
High - Production deployment is blocked due to platform infrastructure issue.
